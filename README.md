# Rain Prediction Model

## Overview
A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of rain in Australia using historical weather data. This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques to solve a real-wolrd meteorological prediction problem.

## Problem Statement
Ever wondered if you should carry an umbrella tomorrow? With machine learning, you can predict next-day rain. This project specifically addresses the challenge of predicting whether it will rain tomorrow based on today's weather conditions.
